'''
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

#solution 1 :(Depth First Search)
Time Complexity : O(N), each node is only traversed once
Space Complexity : O(logN), required for recursive stack. The maximum depth of recursion is equal to the height of tree which in this case of perfect binary tree is equal to O(logN)


def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root: return None
        if root and root.left and root.right:
            root.left.next=root.right
            if root.next:
                root.right.next=root.next.left
            self.connect(root.left)
            self.connect(root.right)
        return root
        
#solution 2 -(BFS - Space-Optimized Appraoch)
Time Complexity : O(N), we only traverse each node once, basically doing a standard BFS.
Space Complexity : O(1), only constant extra space is being used

 def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root:
            return None
        cur=root
        next=root.left
        while cur.left:
            cur.left.next=cur.right
            if cur.next:
                cur.right.next=cur.next.left
                cur=cur.next
            else:
                cur=next
                next=cur.left
        
        return root
